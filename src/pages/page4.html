          <p class="extra-back-desc"><b>No Royalty Fee for Free Software</b>
              The 'free' in Free Software refers to the freedom to use it as and how you want. Users are free to use, study, modify and redistribute the software and even charge for their products and services at their discretion whether it be for one project or a hundred. That is not the case for proprietary software which is also its major disadvantage. You have to pay a hefty price and even then you are limited by the way you can use the software.
              <br>
              <b> Freedom with Code</b>
              Free Software gives users the freedom to use the software or program for any purpose of choice without limitation. Programmers can study the source code and modify it to custom-build software for specialized purposes. Users have the freedom to redistribute and even sell the modified versions. Proprietary Software like Windows, macOS, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Office, and much more are developed for many users and almost always it is limited in the way it can be customised to meet particular needs. Several features may be pointless to the customer but they are not allowed to create a version or edit it using the source code. The source code is not publicly available. All the modifications can be done only by the closed team of creators. Here customers need to adjust their requirements to the available options.
              <br>
              <b>Free Software is Secure</b>
              FOSS has a lot of committed code contributors who keep the software secure and issue-free. The wide network of free software users alerts the community of any vulnerability and issues that are escalated, and are fixed in a very short time frame. Proprietary software lacks this community support. So hackers are paid hefty amounts by the company to keep the software secure which in turn eventually comes from the user's pocket.
